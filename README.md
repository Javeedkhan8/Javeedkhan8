## 🚀 About Me

💻 I'm a **MERN Stack Developer** who’s obsessed with turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and intuitive web applications. I blend logic and creativity to develop seamless experiences across the **full stack**—from backend APIs to elegant frontend interfaces.

🎯 Whether it’s designing a database schema, building REST APIs, or crafting responsive UIs with React and TailwindCSS, I always code with **performance, scalability, and user experience** in mind.

🧠 I believe in **lifelong learning** and am always exploring new technologies, tools, and best practices to level up my craft.

⚡ Here’s what I bring to the table:
- End-to-End Web App Development 🚀  
- Razorpay Payment Gateway Integration 💳  
- Real-Time Chat & Auth Systems 🔐  
- Fully Customized Dashboards & Filtering Logic 🎨  
- Clean, Modular Code with Best Practices ✅
